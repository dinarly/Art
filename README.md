The friendly dragon concept featuring Tasnim, Abdallah, Ai, Zhao, Sakura and Akio — is based upon the previous iteration of Tyson Tan’s Konqi friendly dragon — therefore this derivative work is based upon the same license — Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike.

This repo will contain rough digital sketches. The 3d Blender files will be mostly in other repos so that the repos do not become too large. The 3d artwork will be listed inside this repo and also eventually pinned to IPFS.
